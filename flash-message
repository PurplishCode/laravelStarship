You can store a key of flash-message into the session for next request with a value. So let's take into an example, IF the users with (unauthorized) role tried to access specific page that requires a priviliges. (this->authorize('edit.data', $request))
Then that user will be redirected back into their destined pages. But with the additions of notification stating that they "don't have the necessary permission to access this page". That error logs came from the value of our flash-message.
Where does it come from exactly? Well, upon implementing the redirect method after the user with (unauthorized) role FAILED to access that page, they'll be thrown an exception. And also, we added the with() method, this is our flash-message (Example: return redirect->back()->with()). This takes upto 2 parameters, the key, and value.
Let's say the key and value will be stored as [ with('error', 'You don't have the necessary permission to access this page') ] Then after the user had already redirected back, this flash-message is already stored within the session IF another request were made. But we can also display this. 
By creating a conditioning on the view blade,  @if(session('error')), we're invoking that flash-message that was stored on our session, and this IF condition will be triggered if the user has the key 'error' from their previous attempts.
