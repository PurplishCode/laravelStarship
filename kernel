In Laravel. There are two distinguish Kernel class. Console Kernel and HTTP Kernel. HTTP Kernel is used to handle any HTTP request.
While Console Kernel will handles any console request. HTTP Kernel is also part of the class hierarchy for Laravel.
HTTP Kernel is solely builds on Web-applications foundation. While Console Kernel handles any prompt from our console. In this Laravel documentations however, we'll learn the former.

Kernel receives our request of data. But, instead of HANDLING that data. It handed it over towards our ServiceProvider. Inside of it includes RouteProvider, AuthProvider, lots of it.
First thing Kernel does, It'll loads / bootstraping our ServiceProvider. Then it'll iterates for each Provider to process our registration of data and bootstraping each the ServiceProvider.

ServiceProvider too plays crucial role and responsibility of bootstraping each our Laravel components, suchas Database, Queue, Routing, Validation, etc.
